I finally completed my personal website. I put in the background images I wanted and set up the text the right way. I liked the way I was able to customize the website to be my own, but I was a bit frustrated at times because I could not figure out how to do what I wanted. I am ready to move on to a more complicated and creative project. Stay tuned for my next idea.</p>

Today I completed my idea for the new design of room 1401. It was hard to set up the images with the links on them but once I figured it out, it was extremely easy to transfer with copy and paste. Overall this was a very fun project and I hope these ideas will be considered for this new and improved space.
