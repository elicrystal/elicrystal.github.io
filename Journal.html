<h3>Entry #1 10/21/19:
I finally completed my personal website. I put in the background images I wanted and set up the text the right way. I liked the way I was able to customize the website to be my own, but I was a bit frustrated at times because I could not figure out how to do what I wanted. I am ready to move on to a more complicated and creative project. Stay tuned for my next idea.</h3>
