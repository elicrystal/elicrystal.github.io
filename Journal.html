I finally completed my personal website. I put in the background images I wanted and set up the text the right way. I liked the way I was able to customize the website to be my own, but I was a bit frustrated at times because I could not figure out how to do what I wanted. I am ready to move on to a more complicated and creative project. Stay tuned for my next idea.</p>

Today I completed my idea for the new design of room 1401. It was hard to set up the images with the links on them but once I figured it out, it was extremely easy to transfer with copy and paste. Overall this was a very fun project and I hope these ideas will be considered for this new and improved space.

I have started work on my major project and it is turning out really well so far. The dolphin is working perfectly but we cannot figure out how to score the game so far. Stay tuned!</P>

Today we figured out how to score the game. We have added coins to each spot and when the dolphin touches the coins one point is added. The coins do not work at the moment but we are working on it.

We finally figured out the keys!! It took forever but we finally got it so that it adds one point and they disappear. I am so happy we finally completed this and it is a big step in the right direction.

Today I read an article called JavaScript for cats. It explained how to use JavaScript and explained how to use the inspect element in Chrome. It was very interesting and helped me understand Javascript better.
